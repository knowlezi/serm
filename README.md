# SERM
SERM (short for Simulating the Effects of Releasing Malware) was a project developed by me as part of my undergrad thesis. The aim of the project was to help increase awareness about the amount of insecure devices being distributed by vendors. Using device datasets retrieved from https://shodan.io and open-source information about publically known strains of malware I was able to build a model that simulated the release of these malware strains over my datasets.
